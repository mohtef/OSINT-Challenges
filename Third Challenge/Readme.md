It's obviously shown in the photo that this is "Flinders Street station".
The location of this station is: **Flinders St, Melbourne VIC 3000، Australia.** 
1. **Lat:  37°49'6.50"S**
2. **Long: 144°57'49.55"E** 
the main buildings appears in the photo:
1. IBM building 132m
2. HWT Building  111 m
3. Focus Melbourne Tower from central equity 166 m 

The Hight structure will be Focus Melbourne from central equity with **166m in height**

Solving Time: **30 mins.**
The most problem I faced is the name of the last Tower (Focus Melbourne)

I want to mention that [MapCarta](https://mapcarta.com/) with a good map solution that helped me in HWT and Focus Melbourne.
